	\section{About Me}
\textbf{I drink from the keg of glory. Bring me the finest muffins and bagels in all the land.} %\faBalanceScale\\

	% The Scales of Justice represents the balance of the individual against the needs of society and a fair balance between interests of one individual and those of another. The personification of justice balancing the scales dates back to the Egyptian Goddess of Justice, Maat, who stood for truth and fairness.
